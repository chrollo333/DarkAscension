# Dark Ascension

**Dark Ascension** is my first big personal project based on **React**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Python** (Django), and **PostgreSQL**.
I started it because I couldn't find a nice dedicated source of guides for playing the Shadow Priest specialization in WoW, and since I am among the top player of that spec, 
I just decided to make one myself.
It began with just the guides but so far I also expanded it to feature a WoWHead news page that fetches data from their RSS feed and a discussion page to practice some more backend+frontend integration using PostgreSQL for the database.
The frontend is currently hosted on Netlify and backend on Neon (database)+Render.

## Features

-  **Dynamic tab swapping for guides** — Using props, I managed to make tabs dynamically change content without having to reload the page
-  **Usage of RSS feed parsing** — To generate content for displaying the news page articles, I parse the WoWhead RSS feed on backend.
-  **Discussion page** — A comment page for users to give feedback. (more RESTful API practice)

**Frontend:**
- React + Vite

## Future Plans
